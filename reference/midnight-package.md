# midnight: A Tidymodels Interface for the 'midr' Package

The 'midnight' package implements a 'parsnip' engine for the 'midr'
package, allowing users to seamlessly fit, tune, and evaluate MID
(Maximum Interpretation Decomposition) models with 'tidymodels'
workflows. Development and augmentation of the package are driven by
research from the "Moonlight Seminar 2025", a collaborative study group
of actuaries from the Institute of Actuaries of Japan focused on
advancing the practical applications of interpretable models.
